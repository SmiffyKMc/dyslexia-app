> 🏆 **Competition Submission**: Built for the Google Gemma 3n Hackathon - showcasing innovative on-device AI applications for accessibility and education.

## 🎯 **Project Vision**

Dyslexic AI transforms how people with dyslexia interact with text and develop reading skills. By leveraging **Google's Gemma 3n model** running entirely on-device, we provide real-time, personalized assistance that adapts to each user's unique learning profile - all while maintaining complete privacy and working offline.

> **"Supporting 10% of the population shouldn't compromise their privacy or consume our planet."**

This philosophy drives everything we've built: proving that accessibility technology can be both powerful and responsible.

### **The Problem We Solve**
- **1 in 10 people** have dyslexia, facing daily challenges with reading, writing, and text comprehension
- Traditional learning tools lack personalization and real-time feedback
- Privacy concerns with cloud-based AI solutions for educational content
- Need for accessible, always-available learning support

### **Our Solution**
- **On-device AI inference** using Gemma 3n for complete privacy
- **Sustainable & offline-first** - no servers required, eliminating massive water consumption (ChatGPT uses 500ml of water per 100-word generation)
- **Multimodal capabilities** combining text, speech, and image processing  
- **Adaptive learning system** that personalizes content based on user performance
- **Real-time feedback** for reading, writing, and comprehension activities

## 🤖 **AI Architecture & Innovation**

### **Gemma 3n Integration**
- **Model**: `Gemma-3n-E2B-it-int4` (quantized for mobile optimization)
- **Size**: Multi-GB model with intelligent caching and session management
- **Capabilities**: Text generation + multimodal image understanding
- **Deployment**: 100% on-device inference with no cloud dependencies or server energy consumption

### **Technical Innovations**

#### **🔥 Activity-Based Session Management**
**The Problem**: Traditional AI apps suffer from "context bleeding" where shared sessions accumulate tokens across different activities, leading to crashes when the model's 2048-token limit is exceeded.

**Our Solution**: We developed an innovative **activity-aware session management system** that:
- **Isolates contexts** between different AI operations (OCR, text generation, analysis)
- **Implements activity-specific policies** for token budgets and session lifecycles
- **Prevents crashes** through intelligent session rollover and cleanup
- **Maintains performance** while ensuring reliable operation under heavy usage

#### **⚡ Performance Optimizations**
- **GPU acceleration** with automatic CPU fallback for device compatibility
- **Streaming responses** for real-time user feedback during generation
- **Memory optimization**: 75% reduction in memory usage through image compression
- **Background processing** with cooperative yielding for smooth UI experience
- **Proactive session warm-up** eliminating first-inference delays

#### **🔄 Multimodal Processing Pipeline**
- **OCR optimization**: 400x400px max, 256KB compression for mobile efficiency
- **Gallery-only image selection** (camera removed for reliability)
- **Real-time processing** with confidence estimation and error handling
- **Context-aware text extraction** understanding document layouts and formatting

#### **🌊 Water Conservation Impact**
**The Hidden Cost of Cloud AI**: Traditional AI services consume massive amounts of water for data center cooling:
- **ChatGPT**: 500ml of water per 100-word generation
- **Microsoft's AI operations**: 1.7 billion gallons consumed in 2022 (34% increase due to AI expansion)
- **Data centers**: Up to 5 million gallons per day (equivalent to a town of 10,000-50,000 people)
- **Projected crisis**: 170% surge in data center water use expected by 2030

**Our Solution**: By running Gemma 3n entirely on-device, we eliminate this water consumption entirely, making every AI interaction environmentally sustainable.
