# dyslexic_ai

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Future Optimizations / TODOs

### Profile Update Performance
- [ ] **Session Analysis Caching**: Implement caching for session analysis to avoid re-processing all historical sessions on every profile update. This would significantly improve performance by only analyzing new sessions and merging with cached results.
  - Cache analyzed session data after each update
  - Implement cache invalidation strategy
  - Merge cached results with new session analysis
  - Expected performance improvement: 60-80% faster profile updates

### Other Performance Improvements
- [ ] **Batch Session Processing**: Process multiple sessions in batches for better memory management
- [ ] **Incremental Profile Updates**: Update only changed profile fields rather than full profile replacement
