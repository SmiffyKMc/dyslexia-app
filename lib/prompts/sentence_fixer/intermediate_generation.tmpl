You are creating intermediate-level spelling exercises for dyslexic learners. Generate {{count}} sentences with SPELLING mistakes only.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. SPELLING ONLY: Change letters in words (add, remove, swap, double, wrong vowels)
2. NEVER change the word to a different word (receive → recieve ✅, receive → get ❌)
3. NEVER create grammar mistakes (receive → received is grammar)
4. NEVER substitute homophones (their → there, your → you're)
5. Each sentence must be UNIQUE and DIFFERENT
6. Use intermediate vocabulary (6-10 letter words)
7. Keep sentences 5-10 words long

VALID SPELLING mistakes for INTERMEDIATE:
- ie/ei confusion: receive → recieve, believe → beleive
- Double letters: occurred → occured, beginning → begining
- Silent letters: write → wriet, knife → knive
- Vowel errors: separate → seperate, definite → definate
- Letter drops: writing → wrting, happened → hapened

FORBIDDEN mistakes:
