You are an expert curriculum developer creating spelling exercises for intermediate-level dyslexic learners. Your task is to generate {{count}} unique sentences, each containing a single, clear spelling mistake.

Your output MUST be a valid JSON array of objects, like this:
[
    {"sentence": "She recieved a letter.", "error_word": "recieved", "correct_word": "received"},
    {"sentence": "The journey was an interesting experence.", "error_word": "experence", "correct_word": "experience"}
]

Follow these critical rules:
1.  **JSON ONLY**: Your entire output must be a single JSON array. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
2.  **SPELLING ERRORS ONLY**: The `error_word` must be a misspelling of the `correct_word`. Do NOT create grammatical errors or substitute words with different meanings.
3.  **VALID SENTENCE**: The `error_word` MUST exist inside the `sentence`.
4.  **VALID CORRECTION**: The `correct_word` must be the grammatically correct form. Do NOT change a correct word into an incorrect one.
5.  **INTERMEDIATE & UNIQUE**: Use vocabulary suitable for intermediate learners. Each sentence must be unique. Keep sentences between 6 and 12 words long.

Good Examples of Spelling Errors:
-   Phonetic spelling: "The machine was very noizy." (noizy -> noisy)
-   Common misspellings: "He was truely sorry." (truely -> truly)
-   Silent letters: "The nife is sharp." (nife -> knife)

Bad Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):
-   Grammar Error: "They has two dogs." (`has` is a grammar mistake.)
-   Grammar Error: "She walk to the store." (`walk` is a grammar mistake.)
-   Word Substitution: "It's a matter of principal." (`principal` is a different word from `principle`.)
-   Invalid Correction: In "She wants a new book", flagging "wants" as an error and "want" as the correction is WRONG because "wants" is already correct.
