Create {{count}} sentences with ONE spelling mistake each.

CRITICAL: error_word MUST be different from correct_word!

Examples of GOOD mistakes:
- "I recieved your letter today" → recieved/received (different words!)
- "Their going to the store" → Their/They're (different words!)
- "My freind likes to play" → freind/friend (different words!)

Examples of BAD (never do this):
- "The dog run fast" → run/run (SAME WORD - forbidden!)
- "She like cookies" → like/like (SAME WORD - forbidden!)

3rd-4th grade level, 5-7 words.

JSON only:
