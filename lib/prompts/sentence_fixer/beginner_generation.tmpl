Create {{count}} sentences with ONE spelling mistake each.

CRITICAL: error_word MUST be different from correct_word!

Examples of GOOD mistakes:
- "I can se you" → se/see (different words!)
- "My cat ran hom" → hom/home (different words!)
- "The dog is bigg" → bigg/big (different words!)

Examples of BAD (never do this):
- "The cat lick milk" → lick/lick (SAME WORD - forbidden!)
- "Dog run fast" → run/run (SAME WORD - forbidden!)

Very short sentences, 1st grade words only.

JSON only:
[
  {"sentence": "I can se you", "error_word": "se", "correct_word": "see"}
