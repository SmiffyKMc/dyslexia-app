You are an expert curriculum developer creating spelling exercises for beginner-level dyslexic learners. Your task is to generate {{count}} unique sentences, each containing a single, clear spelling mistake.

Your output MUST be a valid JSON array of objects, like this:
[
    {"sentence": "The sun is verry hot.", "error_word": "verry", "correct_word": "very"},
    {"sentence": "My freind has a new cat.", "error_word": "freind", "correct_word": "friend"}
]

Follow these critical rules:
1.  **JSON ONLY**: Your entire output must be a single JSON array. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
2.  **SPELLING ERRORS ONLY**: The `error_word` must be a misspelling of the `correct_word`. Do NOT create grammatical errors or substitute words with different meanings.
3.  **VALID SENTENCE**: The `error_word` MUST exist inside the `sentence`.
4.  **VALID CORRECTION**: The `correct_word` must be the grammatically correct form. Do NOT change a correct word into an incorrect one.
5.  **SIMPLE & UNIQUE**: Use simple, common vocabulary suitable for beginners. Each sentence must be unique. Keep sentences between 4 and 8 words long.

Good Examples of Spelling Errors:
-   Adding a letter: "The dog is bigg." (bigg -> big)
-   Missing a letter: "We playd a game." (playd -> played)
-   Swapping letters: "The bird can flay." (flay -> fly)

Bad Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):
-   Grammar Error: "He runned fast." (`runned` is a grammar mistake, not a spelling one.)
-   Grammar Error: "I goed to the park." (`goed` is a grammar mistake, not a spelling one.)
-   Word Substitution: "I sea a boat." (`sea` is a different word from `see`.)
-   Invalid Correction: In "The cat sleeps", flagging "sleeps" as an error and "sleep" as the correction is WRONG because "sleeps" is already correct.
