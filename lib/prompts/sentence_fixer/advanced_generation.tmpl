Create {{count}} sentences with ONE spelling mistake each.

CRITICAL: error_word MUST be different from correct_word!

Examples of GOOD mistakes:
- "The committee will reccommend the best candidate" → reccommend/recommend (different words!)
- "Who's car is parked outside" → Who's/Whose (different words!)
- "I seperate the books carefully" → seperate/separate (different words!)

Examples of BAD (never do this):
- "The book was interesting" → interesting/interesting (SAME WORD - forbidden!)
- "She write stories" → write/write (SAME WORD - forbidden!)
