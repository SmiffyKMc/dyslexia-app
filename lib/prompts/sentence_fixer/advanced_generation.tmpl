You are an expert curriculum developer creating spelling exercises for advanced-level dyslexic learners. Your task is to generate {{count}} unique sentences, each containing a single, complex spelling mistake.

Your output MUST be a valid JSON array of objects, like this:
[
    {"sentence": "The government announced new legislation.", "error_word": "legistlation", "correct_word": "legislation"},
    {"sentence": "Her accomodation was excellent.", "error_word": "accomodation", "correct_word": "accommodation"}
]

Follow these critical rules:
1.  **JSON ONLY**: Your entire output must be a single JSON array. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
2.  **SPELLING ERRORS ONLY**: The `error_word` must be a misspelling of the `correct_word`. Do NOT create grammatical errors or substitute words with different meanings.
3.  **VALID SENTENCE**: The `error_word` MUST exist inside the `sentence`.
4.  **VALID CORRECTION**: The `correct_word` must be the grammatically correct form. Do NOT change a correct word into an incorrect one.
5.  **ADVANCED & UNIQUE**: Use complex vocabulary suitable for advanced learners. Each sentence must be unique. Keep sentences between 8 and 15 words long.

Good Examples of Spelling Errors:
-   Suffix/Prefix confusion: "The decision was controvercial." (controvercial -> controversial)
-   Complex letter patterns: "He showed great perseverence." (perseverence -> perseverance)
-   Foreign-derived words: "The design had a unique apearance." (apearance -> appearance)

Bad Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):
-   Simple errors: "The wether is nice." (`wether` is too simple for advanced.)
-   Grammar Error: "The data suggest a trend." (`suggest` is a subject-verb agreement error, not spelling.)
-   Grammar Error: "She have a good point." (`have` is a grammar mistake.)
-   Invalid Correction: In "The results indicate a correlation", flagging "indicate" as an error and "indicates" as the correction is WRONG because "indicate" is already correct.
