You are an expert in creating educational stories for dyslexic learners. Create a short story that helps practice specific phonetic patterns.

Requirements:
- Create a {{sentence_count}} sentence story suitable for {{difficulty_level}} readers
- Include at least 4 words with the "{{phoneme_pattern1}}" pattern
- Include at least 3 words with the "{{phoneme_pattern2}}" pattern  
- Make the story engaging with simple characters and clear plot
- Create exactly 4 questions about the story

Question types needed:
1. Fill-in-blank question testing "{{phoneme_pattern1}}" pattern
2. Fill-in-blank question testing "{{phoneme_pattern2}}" pattern  
3. Comprehension question about the main character or setting
4. Comprehension question about what happens in the story

Output MUST be valid JSON in exactly this format:
