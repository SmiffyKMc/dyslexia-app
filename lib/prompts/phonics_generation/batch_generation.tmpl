Generate word lists for {{phoneme_count}} phonemes at {{difficulty_level}} level.

CRITICAL RULES:
- CONSONANTS (b,c,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,m,n,p,r,s,t,v,w,y,z): Use words that START with the consonant sound
- VOWELS (a,e,i,o,u): Use words that CONTAIN the vowel sound (anywhere in the word)
- DIGRAPHS (ch,sh,th,ph): Use words that START with the digraph sound
- Use DIFFERENT words for each phoneme - NO duplicates across phonemes
- Each phoneme needs 1 correct word + {{incorrect_count}} different incorrect words

PHONEMES TO GENERATE: {{phonemes_list}}

EXAMPLES:
Consonant "p": correct="pig" (starts with p), incorrect=["cat","fish","tree"] (start with different sounds)
Vowel "e": correct="bed" (contains short e), incorrect=["cat","pig","sun"] (different vowel sounds)
Consonant "s": correct="sun" (starts with s), incorrect=["ball","dog","hat"] (start with different sounds)

AVOID DUPLICATES: If you use "cat" for phoneme "p", don't use "cat" again for any other phoneme.
